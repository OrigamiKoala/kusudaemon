"""Stdlib HTTP server mounting :class:`RunState` (PLAN.md §11's "View
surface: local web app") — the ``kusudaemon`` control surface, replacing
the Textual TUI (``tui/app.py``, deleted 2026-08-09 the same day this was
rebuilt; see CLAUDE.md's v5 section for the full back-and-forth: web app
-> TUI -> web app again, this time carrying over every TUI-only feature —
Subagents view, live mid-episode interject, colored diff history, node
reopen — that the original dashboard never had).

No new dependency: routing, JSON, and static-file serving are all
``http.server``/``urllib``/``json`` from the standard library, matching
the rest of the harness's "stdlib + packaging/tomli" rule. One
``ThreadingHTTPServer`` so a long-lived SSE connection (``/api/stream``)
never blocks any other request.

This module owns *transport* only — request parsing, routing, JSON
encoding, path-traversal-safe static serving, and ``control_enabled``
gating for every mutating route. ``RunState`` (``state.py``) itself has no
opinion on read-only mode — that concept doesn't apply to a TUI or a bound
terminal, and it was folded back in here, one layer up, only because a web
server (unlike either of those) may be reachable from more than just the
operator's own machine. Every read or mutation past that gate is a single
call into ``RunState``, which is the authority on what's safe to do to a
run directory (id validation, path-traversal checks, etc).

Two ways to reach this server (PLAN.md §11: "a separate process watching
the run directory... can be attached from anywhere"):

* ``kusudaemon serve --runs-root <dir>`` — the primary, standalone view
  surface; a `run`/`resume`/`--detach` process needs nothing from this
  module to make progress, so the server can start, stop, or crash without
  ever touching a run.
* bare ``kusudaemon`` (no subcommand) — shorthand for ``serve`` with the
  default ``--runs-root``, matching the old bare-invocation ergonomics.

**PLAN.md §C4 — Auth and concurrency hardening (2026-08-11).**

The original dashboard shipped with no auth at all — ``control_enabled``
gates mutating actions, but any anonymous requester reaching the bound
host can read every artifact, every trace, every approval. Loopback-only
default binding made that a small exposure, but ``--host 0.0.0.0`` (the
explicit flag this server exposes) was the only thing keeping the
operator's run directory from being reachable from anywhere on the LAN.

Three hard-earned rules, all enforced in this module:

1. **Refuse to start on a non-loopback host without an auth token.** The
   ``--host`` flag explicitly invites off-loopback binding, so the same
   flag's safety check is what refuses it: ``_assert_safe_host`` raises
   before ``make_server`` ever binds the socket, with a message naming
   the ``--auth-token`` flag the operator needs to set. ``127.0.0.1`` and
   ``::1`` are loopback; any other non-empty host string needs a token.
2. **Token comparison uses ``hmac.compare_digest``** — never ``==``. A
   timing-attack-resistant comparison is cheap; the alternative is not.
3. **Cookie for SSE, not ``Authorization``.** ``EventSource`` cannot set
   custom headers, so the SSE endpoint cannot carry an ``Authorization``
   token the way every fetch route can. ``/api/attach`` issues a
   ``Set-Cookie`` when a token is configured; ``_serve_stream`` and every
   route then validate that cookie with the same timing-safe comparison.
   A non-loopback server without a token never starts (rule 1), so the
   cookie is the second factor for off-loopback and a no-op on loopback
   (where the cookie gate always passes when the token is empty).

Plus ``max_concurrent_runs`` (§C4: "max_concurrent_runs with a surfaced
429"): ``_post_runs`` returns 429 instead of starting a run when the
count of in-flight hosted runs reaches the cap. The cap defaults to 4
(one driver per run is the design; more than a handful is usually a
misconfiguration — provider rate limits will clamp it harder than the
dashboard would, and silently queuing is worse than surfacing the 429).

    long as an episode runs, so re-parsing the whole trace from scratch on
    every call got slower every tick as the trace grew.

    §F1 (2026-08-12 audit): an optional ``?since=<n>`` cursor lets a caller
    fetch only ``parsed_entries[n:]`` instead of the whole (tail-capped)

    ``since`` instead returns everything from that index onward,

    The ``--host`` flag explicitly invites off-loopback binding, so the
    same flag's safety check is what refuses it. A non-loopback host
    exposes every artifact, every trace, every approval to any requester
    who can route to the LAN — a single ``Authorization: Bearer`` (or the
    SSE-equivalent cookie) at least gates the read surface. Loopback
    (``127.0.0.1``, ``::1``, ``localhost``) doesn't need a token: the
    binding itself is the safety.

    Raises ``ValueError`` before ``make_server`` is ever called, so the
    socket is never bound in the unsafe configuration. The error message
    names the ``--auth-token`` flag the operator needs to set, exactly the
    way ``provider_config.resolve`` names the missing env var.

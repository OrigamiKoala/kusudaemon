"""Run-directory state for the web dashboard (PLAN.md §11).

Formerly ``tui/state.py`` (2026-08-09: the Textual TUI was itself replaced
by this web app the same day it was deleted — see CLAUDE.md's v5 section
for the full back-and-forth). Moved here unchanged in spirit: still the
same "read everything fresh from disk on every call" design, still no
``control_enabled``/403 concept on *this* class — that gate now lives one
layer up, in ``dashboard/server.py``'s HTTP handler, since a web server
(unlike a TUI or a bound terminal) may be reachable from more than just
the operator's own machine. The "subagents" view and live mid-episode
messaging the TUI added over the original dashboard state are kept as-is.

Bridges three worlds without coupling them:

* the pipeline driver (hosted in a background thread by this same process,
  or running in a detached ``kusudaemon run`` process — this state never
  tells the difference, because the only contract is the run directory),
* the dashboard server's render loop (snapshots on every request, or every
  SSE tick),
* the operator (approve/amend/reopen/halt/interject actions, over HTTP).

The approval protocol is still ``pipeline/approvals.py``'s: the driver
creates ``pending`` records in ``approvals.jsonl`` and polls until a
``resolved`` record lands; this state resolves by appending that record.
Any other surface — a second terminal running ``kusudaemon approve`` —
resolves the same file, so no surface owns a run.

        a not-yet-created ``events.jsonl`` degrades to the directory stamp

        itself runs unlocked so concurrent snapshot polls don't serialize
        their parsing behind each other, but the two dict accesses both
        hold the lock.

        **Depends on the append-only invariant**: events.jsonl and
        approvals.jsonl are append-only and fsync'd per record
        (v0/events.py's whole contract), so a same-size same-nanosecond
        rewrite can never occur and the cache cannot serve stale data for

        one poll, accepted per §10.2's stated caveat. If anything ever

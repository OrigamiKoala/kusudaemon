"""The research subagent, generalized to probes (PLAN.md §13 v4 "web search
subagent, current-docs retrieval"; PLAN.md §A6/§B4 "delegated, capped,
isolated exploration").

**Why a subagent and not just letting a Writer node call WebSearch itself**:
§8's whole context-discipline argument — raw tool dumps from an open-ended
search (ten results, three fetched pages) are exactly the "raw tool
results" waste §8 ranks second only to unrestricted tool schemas. A
research query is dispatched as its own bounded episode, under its own
derived id, with its own narrow tool allowlist (``mcp_research.py``); only
its capped finding — never the search transcript, never its reasoning —
ever reaches another node's prompt. Same shape as ``v1/writer.py``'s
promotion mechanism, applied one level earlier in the pipeline.

**Why a derived id, not the node's own id**: identical reasoning to
``v3/repair.py``'s docstring — a research query answers one narrow
question *for* a node, it is not that node's own dispatch, so it must not
collide with that node's ``episode_completed`` event in ``events.jsonl``
(v0's ``run_node`` would otherwise no-op-replay it). ``research_node_id``
mirrors ``repair_node_id``'s ``"<id>~repair<n>"`` shape with
``"<id>~research~<slug>"``.

**Resumability layering**: v0's ``run_node`` already makes the *episode*
idempotent per derived id. This module adds one more layer on top for its
own post-processing step (reading the agent's raw finding file, capping
it, writing the canonical finding): ``run_research_query`` checks whether
``research_finding_path`` already holds nonempty text *before* touching
``run_node`` at all, and short-circuits to a cached read if so — the same
"resume-after-complete is a pure no-op" property v0 proves for a single
episode, just one call frame up. This also means a crash between
``episode_completed`` firing and this module's own write of the canonical
finding degrades gracefully rather than losing data: the agent's raw
finding file (``research_raw_finding_path``) is read from disk, not from
the (possibly-replayed, metadata-less) ``EpisodeResult`` — see
``_read_raw_finding``.

**PLAN.md §B4 — ``ResearchQuery`` generalized to ``Probe``.** §A6's table
adds two kinds beyond the original ``web_search``/``doc_retrieval``:
``workspace`` (read + list + grep over a real repo, no write) and
``corpus`` (read over materialized ``spine/`` units only). Per §A12
("``v4/mcp_research.ResearchQuery`` — subsumed by ``Probe`` (alias
kept)"), ``Probe`` is now the real dataclass and ``ResearchQuery`` is a
plain module-level alias (``ResearchQuery = Probe`` — the exact same
class object, not a subclass), so every existing caller
(``pipeline/backends.py``'s ``parse_research_plan``, ``research_loop.py``,
every pre-§B4 test) keeps working unmodified. The legacy spelling
``kind="web_search"`` (still what ``PARSE_RESEARCH_PLAN``'s JSON contract
and every existing test/CLI payload use) is normalized to ``"web"`` in
``Probe.__post_init__`` — construction is the one place this has to
happen for every caller to get it for free, rather than requiring each of
``parse_research_plan``/``mcp_research.allowed_tools_for``/this module's
own ``_PROMPT_PREAMBLE`` lookup to duplicate the alias check.

**Why workspace/corpus probes never need a "no write" carve-out.** Look
at ``build_research_adapter`` (``pipeline/backends.py``): a research
adapter of *any* kind has never included gptme's ``save``/``patch``
tools — only ``allowed_tools_for(kind)``'s narrow allowlist. That was
already true for today's ``web_search`` probes (SearXNG only, no file
tools at all) and is why the write-to-``raw_path`` instruction below has
always been aspirational for them: since the agent has no tool that can
write, the harness falls back to the episode's last assistant message
(see ``run_research_query``), the exact same path
``tests/test_v4_research.py``'s fixture already documents and exercises.
``workspace``/``corpus`` probes follow the identical shape — "no write"
(§A6's table) is enforced by omission from the tool allowlist, not by a
carve-out exception the way a Writer's own ``out/<id>.md`` needs one.

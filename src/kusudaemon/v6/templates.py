"""§C1: the node-type template system (PLAN.md).

Every leaf today ships ``nonempty`` + ``max_tokens`` and an **empty
``judgment``** list, so ``review_node`` auto-passes without a model call
and reviewer pass rate is pinned at 1.0 (PLAN.md §C1's framing: "still the
highest-value gap"). The template system is the thing that decides *which*
gates and judgment items a node of a given ``shape`` / ``type`` should
carry — instead of every leaf looking identical, a ``problem-set-dominant``
leaf gets ``problems>=5`` plus a judgment bar about worked examples being
dereferenced from the chapter's exposition.

**Ship at warn severity first** (PLAN.md's own §C1 ordering): every new
gate the template registry emits goes onto ``node.warn_gates`` rather than
``node.gates``, so a "missing 5th problem" warning reaches the audit file
and the manifest without flipping a passing run into a failing one. The
caller (the planner's ``template_for`` resolver, below) is the one place
that decides this; a test or hand-authored tree may write ``gates`` to
truly enforce a gate, the same way it always could. The plan: watch what
the warn-severity gates actually fire on across real corpora, tighten the
predicate where it is wrong, and only then graduate the entry — same
"ship default-off, measure, then flip" rule (§III.5) every other major
addition since §B1 follows.

**The registry itself is in-repo, not in-DB.** Templates are
hand-authored Python dataclasses (one per (shape, type) pair we know
about today; ``generic`` is the default), so adding a new template is a
code review, not a migration. An unknown ``(shape, type)`` falls back
to the ``generic`` template — never raises — so a free-form goal that
the planner labels with a shape we have no template for still gets a node
that gates on ``nonempty`` and ``max_tokens`` and reviews against the
parts of the contract freeze that landed in its ``rubric`` (today's exact
behavior, in other words).

Interaction with §A4 (PLAN.md's own note): templates are also what let a
T2 run get a real rubric without a pilot — the template's
``judgment``/``rubric`` defaults are what populate a leaf's rubric when
the only contract available is the script-rendered spec.md one
(§A10). Without templates, T2 leaves carry no judgment items at all and
``review_node`` auto-passes free.

    - ``warn_gates``: union the same way. §C1's "ship at warn severity
      first" lives here — the template's warn gates go only onto
      ``warn_gates``, never ``gates``. When ``glossary_path`` is given, a
      ``terms_defined`` warn gate is rewritten to carry it as an absolute
      path arg (``terms_defined:/abs/path/glossary.json``) — the gate
      handler has no run_dir of its own, and the evaluator process's cwd
      is the operator's launch dir, not necessarily the run dir, so the
      *relative* ``glossary.json`` default would silently dereference a
      nonexistent file in the wrong place. The planner's bare call passes
      no path; the driver re-merges with ``glossary_path(run_dir)`` after
      ``build_tree`` so the stored tree.json carries the absolute form

    - ``judgment``/``rubric``: union; existing entries win (the operator
      who froze a contract-derived rubric trumps a template default).
    - ``tools``: set only when the node carries none — an explicitly
      tooled node (a hand-authored tree, a split child that inherited its
      parent's set) keeps its own list. §A6-3's per-shape allowlists
      therefore reach planner-built leaves while T0/T1 direct nodes
      (no shape, ``generic`` template, empty tools) keep the adapter's
      ``DEFAULT_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`` fallback.
    - ``glossary``: the node carries it as a free field (no live use yet
      from this function — the driver writes the glossary to run_dir,
      not the node — but the template provides the content so the driver
      doesn't have to re-derive it). Kept on the template only.

    Pure-additive: a node with empty ``gates``/``warn_gates``/``judgment``
    after this is one whose template's ``template_for(shape, type)``
    resolved to ``generic`` and ``generic`` adds nothing — i.e. today's
    exact behavior, byte-for-byte. A caller who wants *only* template
    gates (no ``nonempty``/``max_tokens``) can post-process; this layer

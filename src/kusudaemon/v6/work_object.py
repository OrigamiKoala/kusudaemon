"""The work object (PLAN.md §A3, §B1) — the single input abstraction that
replaces ``source.txt``-only. Three kinds:

- ``"text"``   — today's corpus-in-a-string mode, unchanged (§4.2).
- ``"workspace"`` — a real directory a Writer's cwd becomes directly (a repo,
  a folder of notes). Never copied into the run dir (§A3 point 2): a
  workspace unit is a set of real paths, and materializing them the way
  ``v2/survey.py:materialize_units`` does for corpus mode would double a
  repo on disk and immediately desynchronize from it.
- ``"none"``   — a goal with no input at all. Legal, degenerate; nothing in
  this module measures it because there is nothing to measure.

Measurement (``measure_workspace``) is deterministic and model-free — pure
filesystem + stdlib, per §A3's "must never require reading file contents
into a model." It reuses ``v1/gates.estimate_tokens`` (the same
words/0.75 heuristic every other token count in this repo uses) rather
than inventing a second approximation.

**Gitignore support is deliberately minimal**, not a full spec
implementation (this repo is stdlib-only, pyproject.toml): exact/glob
patterns via ``fnmatch``, a trailing ``/`` for directory-only patterns, and
patterns anchored to their own ``.gitignore``'s directory when they contain
an internal ``/`` (matched elsewhere in the tree otherwise). ``!`` negation
lines are recognized and skipped, not honored — a false-exclude here just
means one more denylist entry than git itself would apply, which is the
safe direction to be wrong in for a harness deciding what a Writer may
read, not the dangerous one.

"""Tier classification and phase routing (PLAN.md §A4, §B2).

**The problem this exists to solve.** Deterministic size signals cannot
separate "remove a div" from "rewrite the auth layer" in a 500-file repo —
both have the same file count. Only reading the goal against the shape of
the work object can. But if the sizing step itself costs a survey, it has
defeated its own purpose. The resolution: one bounded, advisory model call
(``estimate_scope``), mapped into a tier by a pure code table
(``classify``). The model estimates; the harness decides; every cap is
code, never a model's opinion about whether something "feels too big"
(``CLAUDE.md`` §2 invariant 2, carried into PLAN.md §A2 invariant 2's
amended form).

Two invariants this module exists to serve (PLAN.md §A2, amended set):

8. **Cost scales with the task.** The phase list for a run is computed by
   code from a tier, never chosen by a model and never fixed at seven.
9. **Escalation is one-way.** A run's tier may rise at runtime; it never
   falls. ``escalate`` is the single function that enforces this, so every
   call site (``pipeline/driver.py``, the CLI's ``escalate`` command)
   shares one monotonicity guarantee instead of re-deriving it.

**Signals vs. estimate.** ``Signals`` (§A4.1) is entirely free — string
matching plus fields already computed on ``WorkObject`` (v6/work_object.py,
§B1) at construction time, no model call, no file reads beyond what
measuring the work object already did. ``estimate_scope`` (§A4.2) is
exactly one ``complete_json`` call, same pattern as
``v2/planner.py:plan_level`` / ``v2/intake.py``'s question calls: a system
prompt, one user message, a capped-output schema. It never sees file
contents — a digest of ``top_dirs`` plus a truncated, content-free file
listing (``work_object.iter_workspace_paths``), the same "labels and token
counts, never source" rule ``CLAUDE.md`` §3 states for the Planner.

**``named_paths`` is deliberately coarse.** It checks only whether a
work object's *top-level directory names* appear in the goal text, not
individual file names — a full re-walk to match filenames would double the
I/O ``measure_workspace`` already paid at WorkObject-construction time for
every large-repo run, just to compute one advisory signal. Refining this to
real filename matching is natural follow-up once §B4's probes exist to do
real exploration instead of a free heuristic standing in for it.

"""T0/T1 direct execution paths (PLAN.md §A4.3, §B2).

**T0** ("1 episode, 1 review call, no tree file") never gets a
``tree.json`` — its whole job is one gated Writer episode plus one Reviewer
verdict. It still needs *some* durable, resumable record of that one node's
state (a crash between dispatch and review must resume correctly, same as
every other tier), so it gets its own file, ``direct_node.json`` — the same
``TaskTree`` JSON-array serialization ``tree.json`` uses, just never named
``tree.json`` and never read by ``pipeline/driver.py:_phase_done("plan")``,
which is what "no tree file" actually protects: a T0 run must never look,
to a resuming driver, like planning already happened.

Dispatch and review reuse ``v1/round_loop.py``'s ``dispatch_node``/
``review_and_transition_node`` directly (PLAN.md §3: "don't reinvent
episode dispatch") against an in-memory, single-node ``TaskTree`` — the
exact same gate-cache write, manifest line, and status transition a real
round-loop dispatch produces, so nothing downstream (the dashboard,
``manifest.jsonl`` readers, ``audit/<node>.json`` consumers) needs a
tree-less special case to render a T0 run.

**T1** ("1 node, ≤2 explorers") gets a real ``tree.json`` — unlike T0, its
phase list has no "plan" phase to skip, so the one node it needs is built
directly by code from the goal (``build_single_node_tree``) rather than
spent on a Planner call that has nothing to partition. Once that one-node
tree is on disk, it flows through the *unmodified* ``run_round_loop`` —
which already handles a 1-node tree correctly today, no T1-specific code
needed there at all.

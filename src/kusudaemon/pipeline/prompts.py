"""Prompt assembly for writers (PLAN.md §11 "default node view: brief").

A Writer node's prompt is assembled entirely before its bounded episode
starts (§8 context discipline): brief, then the frozen contract (every
artifact must satisfy it — §4.4), then the node's ``inputs`` — materialized
spine-unit file paths under ``spine/`` (PLAN-zeromem.md §7) and, once v4
research ran, finding file paths — the agent is expected to read itself.
Nothing here is a model call; ``inputs`` are file paths the agent resolves
with its own tools. (Pre-§7 or unmaterialized runs fall back to a bare
unit id — see ``v2/survey.py:unit_input_path`` — which renders the same
way here; the agent just has nothing to open.)

If the node declares ``depends_on`` nodes, the promotions of those nodes
(their capped, writer-authored handoffs, ``manifest.jsonl``) are injected
so a downstream node knows what its upstream actually delivered — closing
the loop ``v1/writer.py``'s prompt promises ("the only part of your work
another node will ever see"). No document-order fallback: with
``depends_on=[]`` everywhere (today's trees) this block is simply absent,
and a wrong heuristic is worse than nothing (PLAN-zeromem.md §11.2).

Finally, if the node carries a ``last_defect`` from a prior failed attempt
(PLAN-zeromem.md §9), it's appended as a retry block — always patch framing
on an in-place retry (a mid-series rewrite burns attempts on a fresh
artifact that must re-clear the same gates); regenerate framing applies
only to an operator redispatch, which resets the node to a fresh attempt
budget and stamps ``last_defect`` with the marker
``dashboard/state.py``'s redispatch job writes (§D31, 2026-08-15).

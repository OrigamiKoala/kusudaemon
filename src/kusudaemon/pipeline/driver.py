"""The pipeline driver: intake -> survey -> plan -> pilot -> contract
freeze -> research -> execute -> assemble (PLAN.md §4, §10, §11).

Everything the web UI and the ``pipeline`` CLI commands run funnels
through this one class. Design rules, in PLAN.md order:

- **Durable progress, resumable phases (§10).** ``phase.json`` records
  ``{phase, status, detail}``, and each phase's *skip* decision is read
  from an artifact file, not from that marker: ``spec.md`` (intake),
  ``spine.json`` (survey), ``tree.json`` (plan), ``contract.md`` (pilot +
  freeze). research/execute/assemble are internally idempotent by their
  own layers (v4's finding cache, v1's round loop, v3's assembly loop), so
  re-running the driver on an existing run dir converges exactly where
  durable state left off — §10's property, composed rather than re-coded.
- **Human gates are disk approvals (§10, §11).** Intake answers and pilot
  edits go through ``approvals.jsonl`` (``approvals.py``): the driver
  creates a pending record and polls until any surface—web app or CLI—
  resolves it. Resume reuses an unanswered pending record instead of
  stacking a duplicate question.
- **Never interrupt mid-turn (§10).** ``halt.flag`` is checked at phase
  boundaries only; everything the v0-v4 layers already made crash-safe
  stays in their hands.
- **Per-node prompts assembled up front (§8).** ``build_node_prompt``
  renders brief + contract + inputs *before* a writer episode opens.

The driver never constructs an adapter: callers inject
``writer_adapter_factory`` / ``research_adapter_factory``; the defaults
come from ``backends.py`` driven by ``RunOptions.backend``.

        """PLAN.md §A4/§B2: the one advisory model call that decides how
        much of the rest of the pipeline this run actually needs. Writes
        ``tier.json``; ``run()`` re-reads it every iteration of its phase
        loop, and every escalation trigger (below) rewrites just its
        ``tier`` field via ``_write_tier_record``.

        ``--tier`` is a floor, never a ceiling (invariant 9): the estimate
        call still runs (so the record is honest about what the harness
        would have chosen on its own) *unless* the floor is already T3 —
        T3 already runs every phase the estimate could have gated, so
        spending a call whose verdict is guaranteed to be overridden is
        pure waste. Any other forced floor (T0/T1/T2) still measures for
        real, because ``max(measured, floor)`` can still come out higher
        than the floor itself.

        A5-1 (IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-COST-AND-LIVE.md) adds a second skip: an
        explicitly intake-disabled run (``--no-intake``) whose free size
        signals already force ≥T2 (``work_tokens >= 150_000``) — the call
        would only gate T0/T1 and trigger intake, both moot. Measured tier
        then falls out of ``classify`` on the empty estimate, which
        resolves to T2.

        A5-2: the call itself is the merged ``estimate_scope_full`` —
        scope estimate plus intake round-1 questions/objections in one
        response. The round-1 set is stored in ``tier.json`` under
        ``intake_round1`` so a resume re-asks the exact same questions
        without re-calling the model.

        A5-5: ``needs_explore`` folds in the T1 gate — a T1 run explores
        only when the estimator could not bound the blast radius
        (``files_touched == "unknown"``), which ``classify`` forces to ≥T2
        anyway; the formula keeps the stored record honest for an
        operator-forced ``tier set T1``.

        the work object is a corpus or a workspace (§B1's
        ``survey_workspace``). Kept as its own method rather than a rename
        of ``_phase_survey`` for two reasons: (1) pre-existing tests call
        ``_phase_survey`` directly by name (§D4's corpus-less-raises test,
        the explorer-reasoning test) and stay correct unmodified; (2) a

        §A4.3's "explore? fires only when ``answerable_without_exploration``

        ``spine.json`` is *not* itself optional — "plan" needs it
        unconditionally, at every tier that has a plan phase — so this
        method always ensures it exists regardless of ``needs_explore``.
        What ``needs_explore`` actually gates is (1) structural exploration
        — one bounded probe per top-level ``SpineUnit``, capped by
        ``max_explorers_for(tier)``, T2+ only (T1 has no "plan" phase to
        feed a summary into; T0 has no "explore" phase at all) — and (2)
        running v4's research loop early when the operator supplied an
        explicit ``research_plan`` (same gate ``_phase_research`` already
        uses for the "targeted, post-intake" pattern, §A6's second bullet,

        Two paths, in priority order:

        1. **Operator-supplied** ``options.research_plan`` — unchanged
           from pre-§C3 behavior. The plan is the contract; the harness
           never second-guesses it.
        2. **Auto-planned** (§C3) — when ``options.auto_probe_plan`` is on
           and no explicit plan was supplied, build one from the probe
           planner (windowed ``complete_json`` over candidate leaves).
           This is the "targeted exploration" §A6 names — a model-driven
           decision about which leaves benefit from a probe, gated by a
           deterministic ``needs_probe`` filter and a per-window cap, so
           a model that suggests probes to avoid work is bounded.

        Both paths feed the same ``run_research_loop`` (the existing
        targeted-loop machinery), so findings attach to ``node.inputs``
        exactly the way operator-supplied findings already do.

        PLAN-AUDIT.md §E14: ``phase`` names which ``phase.json`` entry the
        capability-refusal branch below stamps. This method is called two
        ways — as its own top-level phase (``_run_phase("research", ...)``,
        the T3 phase-list entry, where the default ``"research"`` is
        correct and matches what ``_run_phase``'s own tail is about to
        write) and as a sub-step of ``_phase_explore`` while the run is
        still, structurally, in the "explore" phase. The old hardcoded
        ``self._set_phase("research", ...)`` was correct for the first
        caller and a bug for the second: it clobbered ``phase.json``'s
        ``phase`` field with "research" while ``_phase_explore`` (and the
        ``_run_phase("explore", ...)`` frame that invoked it) was still
        running, so a dashboard poll in that window saw ``research/done``
        mid-explore. ``_phase_explore`` now passes ``phase="explore"``.

          gates twice with a size defect -> promote to T2") — see
          ``v6/direct.py:DIRECT_MAX_ATTEMPTS``'s docstring for why 2, not 3.
        - **T2/T3** — unchanged from pre-§B2 behavior save one addition:
          the round loop over whatever ``tree.json`` planning already
          produced, but now also wired for runtime split (PLAN.md §A8/
          §B5) via the ``split_handler``/``on_node_passed`` callables
          (``v7/split.py``) — never for T1 (single node, its own
          size-overrun path is ``size_defect_retry`` below, a deliberately
          different move — replan for real at T2 rather than graft a

          injected callables rather than a direct import there.

        The size-defect escalation check only applies to T1 (T0's own
        check lives in ``_phase_verify``, since T0 never touches
        ``tree.json``/``TaskTree.is_blocked()`` at all). The

        applies to T2 — T3 is already the escalation ceiling that trigger

        Per-node review already happened *inside* ``_phase_execute`` —
        ``v1/round_loop.py``'s dispatch and review are coupled per node (a
        node cannot be reviewed before its own gates pass, and splitting
        that into two fully separate global passes over the whole tree is a
        larger restructuring than this workstream's scope). For T1/T3 this
        phase spends nothing further: it just reports whether the tree
        execute produced is blocked.

        **T2 gets one more thing here, unconditionally (PLAN.md §A9's
        table row: "T2: gates + review_node per leaf + one cross-leaf
        consistency pass"):** ``document_review``'s passes 1-3 (coverage,
        duplication, contract-compliance — already windowed over
        promotions, never artifact prose) run every T2 execution, not only
        when the operator opts in via ``RunOptions.document_review``. That
        flag still gates T3's *additional* depth pass (§A11: "T3: as
        today") — this is a difference in what tier T2 structurally *is*,
        not a change to the flag's meaning. ``keep_depth_pass=False`` here
        is what keeps T2 to exactly the 3 windowed passes the table
        promises, without T3's extra per-artifact spot check.

        The triage this pass produces is handled the same way T3's
        flag-gated document review handles its own
        (``_handle_document_review_triage``, factored out so both callers
        share the majority-regenerate escalation guard, the repair
        dispatch, and the audit log line) — except **T2 applies repairs
        without an operator approval gate.** This mirrors §A10's own
        reasoning for why the pilot/contract's ``awaiting_approval`` state
        is T3-only: "a run the operator expected to take four minutes must
        not silently park overnight waiting for a form." A T2 run is the
        cheap/fast tier by construction (no pilot, no contract-freeze
        interview); parking it on a human gate for a check that only ever
        proposes *scoped, gate-and-review-checked* repairs (same guardrail
        as every other repair path — snapshot, gates + review, only then
        overwrite) would reintroduce exactly the overnight-park failure
        mode §A10 was written to avoid, for a tier whose whole point is
        that it doesn't need one. T3 keeps asking, unchanged, because a T3
        run has already paid for a pilot/contract interview and the
        operator is already in the loop for that run.

        An unattributable cross-leaf defect (``review.escalated`` — a
        defect ``document_review`` could not pin to any node id) escalates
        this phase exactly like an unattributable compile failure escalates
        ``assembly_loop.py`` — the operator's `reopen_node` intervention is
        the recovery path, not something this phase can resolve on its
        own.

        PLAN-AUDIT.md §E17: ``_phase_done`` treats "review" as always
        re-run (it's tier-scoped, per the class docstring's ``_ran_key``),
        so a process-level resume calls this method again even though
        nothing about the artifacts changed since the last time it ran.
        Wrapped in ``_document_review_cached_pass`` below, which skips the
        real call entirely when a digest of exactly this pass's inputs
        (every reviewed node's promotion+brief, the frozen contract text,
        and ``keep_depth_pass``) matches what's on disk from the last time

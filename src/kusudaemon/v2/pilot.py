"""Pilot — the consistency mechanism (PLAN.md §4.4).

Sizing classifies nodes by shape; run **one pilot per shape**
(``select_pilot_nodes``), not "the first node" — the first chapter of
anything is atypical, so this picks the shape's median-by-id node rather
than whichever sorts first.

For each pilot: the Writer produces the artifact via v1's
``run_writer_node`` (reused unmodified — pilot writing isn't special), then
the harness records a durable ``pilot_awaiting_approval`` event and
returns. This is a durable event-log state, not a blocking prompt (§4.4:
"the user can return the next morning") — resuming is just calling
``approve_pilot`` whenever the edit is ready, no different in kind from v0's
crash-resume.

``approve_pilot`` is that resume point: it takes the user's on-disk edit,
diffs it against what the Writer produced, writes the edit back as the
canonical artifact, and turns the diff into contract rules via one small
model call — inferring "user deleted every historical aside" from a diff
needs judgment a heuristic can't supply (§4.4: "the diff is the
highest-signal input in the whole system"). An empty diff derives no rules
and spends no model call.

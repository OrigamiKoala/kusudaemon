"""Contract storage (PLAN.md §4.4, §5, §A10).

``contract.md`` is frozen after the pilot, with a hard token ceiling
(§5: "frozen after pilot; hard token ceiling"). Only **three** things may
ever write to it: pilot derivation (``pilot.approve_pilot`` produces the
``ContractRule``s that ``freeze_contract`` writes here), explicit user
amendment (``amend_contract``), and the **T2-only script renderer**
(``render_spec_rubric_to_contract`` — PLAN.md §A10: "T2's contract is
``spec.md``'s frozen global rubric rendered into ``contract.md`` by script,
zero calls, no human gate"). **Reviewer suggestions must never reach it**,
or requirements inflate monotonically and node 30 ends up held to a stricter
bar than node 2 (§4.4). The T2 script path is the third writer precisely
because T2 does not run a pilot — a tier scoped *out* of the human-gate
machinery still needs *some* contract for ``build_node_prompt`` to read, and
finding it empty would silently drop every contract-derived rubric from
every T2 leaf's prompt.

Re-validating already-passed nodes against an amendment (§10's clean /
patchable / regenerate triage) is v3 scope (§13: "assembly and repair...
re-validation pass for contract amendments") — ``amend_contract`` here only
appends and re-freezes the text; it does not touch ``tree.json``.

    Reads the frozen ``spec.md`` (the product of intake — §A5's adaptive
    question-set design, or the zero-call ``_write_minimal_spec`` skip path
    when the scope estimate found nothing to ask) and renders its rubric /
    assumptions / unresolved-objections sections into ``contract.md``'s
    shape so ``pipeline/prompts.py``'s existing ``_load_contract_cached``
    picks it up the same way it does a pilot-frozen contract.

    **Why a script, not a no-op.** T2's leaves still need *something* to read
    when their prompt asks them to satisfy "the global contract": a missing
    ``contract.md`` silently drops the contract block entirely, and at T2 —
    which is the cheap tier precisely because it skips the pilot interview —
    there is nothing else to put in its place except what intake already
    froze. The script path is what makes "T2 has no human gate" honest
    rather than a synonym for "T2 has no contract at all."

    **Package-private to the driver.** Called by
    ``pipeline/driver.py``'s ``_phase_plan`` (T2: after planning, since
    spec.md already exists by then — intake wrote it) and by
    ``_phase_done("pilot")``'s T2 sub-branch so the phase-skip machinery

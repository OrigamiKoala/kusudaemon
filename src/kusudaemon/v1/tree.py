"""Task state as JSON (PLAN.md §6 Node schema, §13 v1: "task state in JSON;
markdown only as a rendered view").

v1 has no planner yet (that's v2's recursive decomposition), so trees are
hand- or script-authored and loaded whole. What v1 does enforce, on every
load, is invariant 2 from PLAN.md §2 and the v1 build-ladder line itself:
**no node enters the tree without a machine-checkable exit condition** —
``TaskNode`` construction rejects a node with an empty ``gates`` list.

One field here is a v1-only extension not in the PLAN.md §6 example:
``rubric``, a ``{judgment_id: one-line imperative}`` map. §6 shows
``"judgment": ["R1", "R2", "R3"]`` as bare ids because in the full design
the imperative text is derived from the frozen contract (§4.4, v2+). v1 has
no contract yet, so ``rubric`` carries that text directly on the node until
contract derivation exists to generate it.

``"stale"`` was added to ``NodeStatus`` for v3 (PLAN.md §10: "Amend
contract... completed nodes now stale"). A passed node whose contract
amendment re-validation (``v3/revalidate.py``) comes back patchable or
regenerate is marked stale rather than reset to "pending" or left
"passed" — neither of those states means what actually happened: it isn't
untouched work, and it isn't yet re-confirmed against the amendment.
Purely additive: no v1/v2 code path that never amends a contract ever
produces this status.

``last_defect`` was added for PLAN-zeromem.md §9 (feedback-carrying
retries): a retry's prompt is otherwise byte-identical to the first
attempt's, making attempts 2 and 3 i.i.d. resamples rather than a
correction loop. ``round_loop.py`` records the located gate/reviewer
failure here on a failed attempt and clears it on success;
``pipeline/prompts.py:build_node_prompt`` reads it to render a retry block.
Purely additive and defaulted, like ``"stale"`` above — every existing
``tree.json`` loads unchanged.

``"split"`` and ``parent`` were added for PLAN.md §A8/§B5 (runtime
recursive decomposition — ``v7/split.py``): a Writer episode that finds its
own brief too large to complete may propose a partition instead of
submitting, and once the harness-side split gate (``v7/split.py``) accepts
it, the node's status becomes ``"split"`` rather than ever reaching
"passed" — it is a genuine, successful terminal outcome (its artifact
becomes the script-concatenation of its now-grafted children, PLAN.md
§A8.3), just not one produced by submitting a document itself. It is
included in ``_TERMINAL_STATUSES`` (never dispatched again) but is
*excluded* from ``_IN_FLIGHT_STATUSES`` and, deliberately, treated as
complete-equivalent by ``TaskTree.is_complete()`` below — a run whose only
unfinished-looking node is a split parent must not read as permanently
stuck (``v1/orchestrator.py``'s ``_arbitrate_empty_ready`` would otherwise
escalate a fully successful run as "no ready nodes and nothing in
flight"). ``parent`` is the reverse edge, purely additive and defaulted to
``""`` like ``last_defect``/``stale`` above: a grafted child's own id is
already ``f"{parent.id}.{child.id}"`` (the same dot-hierarchical scheme
``v2/planner.py`` uses for recursive planning, which is also what makes the
split visible in the dashboard's task tree for free — it already groups by
dot-path), but the id alone doesn't let code distinguish "a genuinely
independent leaf whose id happens to contain a dot" from "a node grafted by
a split," and ``v3/checks.py:check_split_parents_derived`` /
``v7/split.py:maybe_derive_split_parent`` both need that distinction
explicitly rather than re-deriving it by string-splitting an id.

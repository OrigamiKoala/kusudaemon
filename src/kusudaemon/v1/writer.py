"""Writer node execution for the v1 round loop (PLAN.md §3, §5, §13).

Wraps v0's resumable ``run_node`` unchanged — session capture, crash
resume, and the resume-after-complete no-op all come along for free — and
adds the one thing v1 needs on top: the Writer's handoff back to the
harness is capped at ~400 tokens (§13 v1 scope: "Writer returns capped at
~400 tokens").

Per-node tool restriction (§5: "tools is per-node... the single biggest
token lever") is *not* done here. It lives in how the caller builds the
``adapter`` it hands in — see ``round_loop.py`` and
``ClaudeCodeAdapter(allowed_tools=...)`` — because the Claude Code CLI
bakes its tool policy into the command line at adapter construction time,
before any single episode runs.

v1 has no template/type system yet (v2's planner), so there's no in-band
structured-output channel for the writer to hand back JSON the way
Orchestrator/Reviewer do — it's still a full agent-CLI loop. Instead the
prompt asks the agent to write a short handoff to
``scratch/<node>/promotion.json``. If it doesn't (an older prompt, a model
that ignores the instruction), the harness falls back to the episode's own
visible output/log so the cap is still enforced either way.

**The split-proposal hint (PLAN.md §A8/§B5) is conditional, not a standing
instruction.** ``_inputs_exceed_budget`` recomputes, before every dispatch,
whether this node's own resolved ``inputs`` already exceed
``node.budget.tokens`` — the exact same measurement
``v7/split.py:evaluate_split``'s precondition 1 makes independently (this
module cannot import that one; see ``v1/round_loop.py``'s docstring for
the layering reason). Only when it's already true does ``writer_prompt``
append the split-option instruction: "a node that cannot legally split is
never told it can" (§B5) — telling every node it may split would invite
the exact failure mode §A2 invariant 2 exists to forbid (a model splitting
to avoid work), and ``v7/split.py``'s own gate would reject the proposal
anyway once it arrived, wasting the attempt this hint is meant to help
avoid wasting.

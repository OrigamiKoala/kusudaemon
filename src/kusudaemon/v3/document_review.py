"""Document-level review passes (PLAN-zeromem.md §8).

PLAN.md §3's Reviewer sees one artifact against its own rubric, in
isolation — structurally incapable of seeing the defect class
decomposition creates: two nodes covering the same ground, gaps at unit
boundaries, terminology drift, contradictions between sections. §8 moves
the semantic bar from a *precondition* of passing (which the default
planner never exercises anyway — every leaf ships with an empty
``judgment``, so ``review_node`` auto-passes) to a *post-condition* of
the run, checked on the assembled document.

The whole-document index is already on disk and already paid for: one
``manifest.jsonl`` line per completed leaf, carrying the writer's own
≤400-token ``promotion`` (§8.4). Passes 1–3 read **promotions + briefs
only**, never artifact prose, so a pass must be attributed to a node via
the ``node_ids`` field on its verdict items (added to ``VERDICT_SCHEMA``
per §8.8 — ``id`` keeps meaning rubric-item id, since
``v3/revalidate.py:classify_verdict`` reads ``class`` off those same
items). Every returned id is validated against ``tree.nodes``; unknown
ids are dropped and logged, never trusted and never crashed the pass; a
defect with no attributable node goes to escalation, exactly like an
unattributable compile failure in ``assembly_loop.py``.

Only the depth pass (pass 4) opens artifacts — the ≤4 shape-median nodes
``v2/pilot.py:select_pilot_nodes`` already picks, reused unmodified
(§8.5, §8.12: cut it by calling ``run_document_review`` with
``keep_depth_pass=False``; it is the only remaining check on single-node
quality once per-window passes run).

Token budget: for large trees the pass context is windowed exactly like
``v2/survey.py``'s stage 2 (``DEFAULT_REVIEW_WINDOW``/``STRIDE``), so
calls scale with *windows*, not nodes — the entire point of §8's cost
table (≤16 calls flat for N=400, versus 400 for per-leaf review).

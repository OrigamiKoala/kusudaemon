"""The v3 assembly entrypoint (PLAN.md §4.6, §13): concatenate, run
cross-cutting checks, compile, and repair compile failures — mirroring how
v1's ``round_loop.py`` is the entrypoint that ties Orchestrator/Writer/
Reviewer together, this is the entrypoint that ties assemble/checks/compile/
repair together.

Order matches §4.6's own ordering (concatenation, then checks, then
compile) because each step is a cheaper, more targeted gate than the next:
checks are free and catch structural breakage (a missing artifact) that
would otherwise surface as a confusing compile error; compiling a doc that
already fails checks just wastes the compile budget.

**Compile-failure repair loop** (§4.6.3: "A compile error becomes a repair
node scoped to the offending file, which goes back through review"): this
module never edits ``out/`` itself — see repair.py's docstring for why that
guardrail matters. It only ever identifies *which* passed node's artifact
the compile log implicates (``find_offending_nodes``, a plain substring
match against each node's artifact filename — this harness has no
LaTeX-log parser and doesn't need one to attribute a failure to a file) and
hands that off to ``repair.run_repair``. If the log can't be attributed to
any node, this stops and escalates rather than guessing (same "don't loop
forever, don't guess" posture as v1's ``max_attempts`` and PLAN.md §10's
"if the amendment was itself the mistake, you'll only realize it three
chapters in" — better to ask than to thrash).

**Document-level review** (PLAN-zeromem.md §8, opt-in via
``document_review=True``): after assemble and before compile, run the
read-only document review passes; the triage rides back on
``AssemblyRunResult.review`` so the caller can present counts through an
approval and dispatch repairs via the existing §10 path — repairs are
never dispatched from inside this module. An unattributable review defect
escalates exactly like an unattributable compile failure does.

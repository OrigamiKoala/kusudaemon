"""Contract-amendment re-validation (PLAN.md §10, §15.5).

A user amendment (``v2/contract.amend_contract``) changes the rules
downstream of nodes that already passed under the old contract — §10:
"completed nodes now stale". Blanket-regenerating everything is explicitly
rejected: "Do *not* blanket-regenerate." Instead, re-run the existing
Reviewer — read-only, stateless, **no writers dispatched** — against the
amended contract, and triage each already-passed node into:

- **clean** — already satisfies the amendment, no action.
- **patchable** — small scoped edit closes the gap (an additive amendment:
  "every unit needs a summary box" → append one).
- **regenerate** — the amendment contradicts what's written ("worked
  solutions → hints-only"), no small edit fixes it.

§10 also requires showing a cost estimate *before* running the pass
(``estimate_revalidation_cost``) and presenting triage counts for approval
*before* executing any repair (``summarize_triage``) — this module only
performs the read-only classification; ``apply_revalidation_triage`` is a
separate, explicit call so a caller can insert that approval gate between
them exactly as §10 describes ("Present counts, get approval, then
execute").

Patchable and regenerate both execute through ``repair.run_repair`` — a
regenerate is simply a repair whose prompt asks for a full rewrite instead
of a minimal edit (``repair.RepairMode``), not a separate code path; the
"scoped, located defect" both share is here derived straight from the
reviewer verdict's own ``defect``/``id`` fields.

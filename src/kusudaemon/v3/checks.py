"""Cross-cutting checks (PLAN.md §4.6.2) — script, no model call, catches
cross-unit breakage that per-unit review can't see by construction (a
reviewer only ever sees one artifact, §3).

PLAN.md's example list — "do all refs_out resolve? is every used term in
glossary.json? duplicate definitions? continuous numbering? empty
sections?" — needs the node-type template system to have data to check
(``refs_out``, term extraction): v1's gates and v2's planner both document
that system as still unbuilt, and v3's Progress note repeats it. So this
module checks the cross-cutting properties that *are* derivable today from
``tree.json``, ``manifest.jsonl``, and the actual files in ``out/``:
missing/empty artifacts, nodes not yet passed (the "continuous" property
that's actually meaningful pre-template-system: nothing missing from the
sequence), gate drift (an artifact that passed its gates at dispatch time
but no longer does — someone or something touched ``out/`` since), and a
passed node with no matching manifest line. (An earlier draft also checked
for duplicate artifact paths across node ids; dropped because
``node_artifact_path`` derives the path purely from the node id and
``TaskTree.nodes`` is a dict keyed by id, so that collision is structurally
unreachable, not just unlikely.)

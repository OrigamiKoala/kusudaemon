"""Concatenation + index (PLAN.md §4.6.1) — the first of the three assembly
steps, and one of the two that need no model at all.

Ordering comes from ``tree.json`` itself, exactly as §4.6.1 specifies
("Generate main.tex (or equivalent) with \\input{} lines ordered from
tree.json"): ``TaskTree.nodes`` is a plain dict, but it's built by
``TaskTree.load`` via a dict comprehension over the JSON array in file
order, and the planner (``v2/planner.py``) writes candidates to that array
in the same left-to-right order it walked the spine. So the dict's
iteration order already *is* document order — no separate "order" field to
invent or keep in sync.

The output is deliberately generic (``assembly/main.md``, artifacts
concatenated with a heading per node) rather than LaTeX-specific — this
harness is corpus-agnostic (PLAN.md §1) and most corpora it runs over don't
compile at all. A caller that does need ``main.tex`` (or any other
compiled format) passes its own ``render`` callable; ``compile.py``'s
compile gate is likewise opt-in, not assumed.

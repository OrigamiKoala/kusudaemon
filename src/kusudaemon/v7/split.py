"""Runtime recursive decomposition (PLAN.md §A8, §B5): "a subagent that
finds its subtask too large breaks it down and dispatches its own
children."

**Adopted with the decision gate moved from the model to the harness**
(PLAN.md §A2 invariant 2, amended): a Writer may *propose* a split by
writing ``scratch/<node>/split.json`` instead of (or as well as) an
artifact, but the harness decides whether it is accepted — never the
model's own opinion that a task "feels too big." ``evaluate_split`` is the
whole gate, pure and side-effect-free; ``graft_split``/
``handle_split_proposal`` are the only things here that touch disk or
``tree.json``.

**Why this module cannot literally reuse ``v2/planner.py:_repair_partition``
unchanged (PLAN.md's own text says "reuse `_repair_partition` unchanged").**
That function's ``Candidate``s carry ``unit_start``/``unit_end`` — integer
indices into a spine-unit list, so overlap/gap repair is interval algebra
(sort by start, truncate on overlap, insert a forced span over any hole). A
split child instead declares ``inputs: list[str]`` — an explicit, unordered
claim on a *subset of the parent node's own ``inputs`` list* (which is
itself just a flat list of file references, not a spine with positional
meaning). There is no "interval" to repair; the only structural invariant
worth enforcing is set-based: every one of the parent's inputs claimed by
*exactly one* child. ``_tile_children`` below is a deliberate set-based
analog of ``_repair_partition``'s policy, not its code: first-claim-wins on
a duplicate (mirrors "overlap truncated"), an uncovered remainder folded
into one synthetic forced child (mirrors "gap filled with a forced leaf"),
and a harness-authored repair event (``split_partition_repaired``, named to
match ``planner_partition_repaired``) whenever the model's own partition
needed correcting. When the parent declares no ``inputs`` at all there is
nothing to tile against, so repair is skipped entirely and every child's
own claimed inputs pass through unchanged — an edge case, not the common
one, since §A8.2's own precondition 1 (measured overrun) is what makes a
split legal in the first place, and an input-less node can only overrun via
a prior size-class gate failure (``is_size_defect``), not its inputs.

**Why ``leaf_gate`` (``v2/planner.py``) *is* reused verbatim.** Its body
only ever reads ``.brief``/``.tokens``/``.estimated_calls`` off whatever
it's handed — ``unit_start``/``unit_end``/``shape``/``id`` are never
touched. ``_leaf_gate_for_child`` below adapts a repaired split child into
a throwaway ``Candidate`` (placeholder ``shape="prose-dominant"``,
``unit_start=unit_end=0`` — inert values the function never reads) purely
to satisfy that dataclass's required fields, then calls ``leaf_gate``
unmodified. A child failing it rejects the *whole* proposal (PLAN.md §B5's
own test list: "a child failing leaf_gate rejects the whole proposal, not
a partial accept") — evaluate_split short-circuits on the first failure
rather than collecting a partial accepted set, because a partial split
would leave some of the parent's inputs covered by real children and the
rest silently uncovered by nothing.

**The five §A8.2 preconditions, all in code, checked in this exact
order** (``evaluate_split``): (1) measured overrun — either the node's own
resolved ``inputs`` already exceed ``node.budget.tokens``, or a prior
attempt's ``last_defect`` already named a size-class gate
(``v6/direct.py:is_size_defect`` — the exact precedent PLAN.md points at,
reused directly); (2) budget remains — ``depth(node.id) < depth_cap`` and
``len(tree.nodes) < node_cap``, the same ``DEFAULT_DEPTH_CAP``/
``DEFAULT_NODE_CAP`` constants ``v2/planner.py:build_tree`` already uses;
(3) the repaired children tile the parent's inputs; (4) every repaired
child passes ``leaf_gate``; (5) ``2 <= len(children) <= 8``. **Any**
failure rejects the whole proposal and, per PLAN.md's own §A8.2 framing
("all must hold, **or the proposal is rejected and the attempt is
preserved (not burned)**") — not just precondition 1's own bullet — leaves
the node's ``attempts`` untouched and reverts its status from
"dispatched" back to "pending" (not left at "dispatched" forever, which
would strand it: nothing else transitions a "dispatched" node back to
ready within a single continuous ``run_round_loop`` call). A
``split_rejected`` event names which precondition failed.

**Depth.** PLAN.md: "depth of a node: the number of ``.``-separated
segments in its id minus one." ``planner.py``'s ``build_tree`` builds ids
via ``f"{path}.{candidate.id}"`` when recursing, so a top-level leaf
(``"ch01"``) has zero dots (depth 0) and ``"ch01.sub2"`` has one (depth 1)
— ``node_id.count(".")`` is exactly that.

**Where the split-detection hook plugs in, and why not ``v6/direct.py``.**
This module never calls ``dispatch_node``/``review_and_transition_node``
itself — ``v1/round_loop.py`` calls *this* module's functions via two
injected callables (``split_handler``, ``on_node_passed``) so that lower
layer never has to import this one (see that module's docstring for the
layering argument in full). ``pipeline/driver.py`` wires
``handle_split_proposal``/``maybe_derive_split_parent`` in only for the
T2/T3 round-loop path — never for T0 (no ``tree.json`` to graft into) or
T1 (its size-overrun path is the already-shipped, already-tested
``size_defect_retry`` escalation, a deliberately different and simpler
move: re-plan the whole node for real at T2, not graft a partial
partition onto a single-node tree that's about to be archived anyway).

**Where the parent's derived artifact gets written (PLAN.md §A8.3:
"script concatenation of its children ... not an 'integrator' episode").**
``maybe_derive_split_parent`` is the ``on_node_passed`` hook: every time
*any* node's status becomes "passed", it checks whether that node has a
``parent`` whose own status is "split" and whose siblings (every node
sharing that ``parent``) have *all* reached "passed" — if so it (re)writes
the parent's ``out/<parent>.md`` as ``v3/assemble.py:concatenate_artifacts``
scoped to just those sibling ids, in the order they were grafted. Cheap to
recheck on every passing node rather than tracking "is this the last
child" explicitly (module docstring of ``v1/round_loop.py``), and
idempotent — rewriting an already-correct derived artifact is a no-op in
substance. ``v3/checks.py:check_split_parents_derived`` re-derives the same
concatenation independently and flags drift, so this write path is never
the sole guarantee of correctness.

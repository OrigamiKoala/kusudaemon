"""PLAN.md §C5 measurement functions — pure analysis over a run directory
plus a recorded provider-call list.

The eval harness's job is a cost claim plus a correctness claim, both of
which must come out of the run directory and the call log rather than out
of prose: **calls-by-tier** ("the entire claim of §A4 is a cost claim, and
a cost claim without a number is a preference") and **escalation
precision** ("high escalation means the classifier is too aggressive;
zero escalation across varied tasks means it is too conservative").

Every function here is deterministic and disk-based — no provider calls,
no network. The harness drives real ``RecursiveDriver`` runs (fake
provider/adapters in the sandbox, real ones when an operator runs it with
a key) and hands the recorded calls to these functions; the same
functions serve both, so the number a fake run reports is the number a
real run reports.

Provider calls are recorded as ``(messages, schema)`` pairs (the exact
shape ``FakeProvider.calls`` keeps). Calls are classified by their
schema's top-level properties — each ``complete_json`` role in this
codebase asks for a structurally distinct schema, so the classification is
stable without touching the driver. ``VERDICT_SCHEMA`` serves both the
per-leaf reviewer and document review's windowed passes; both are
"reviewer" calls here, which is the honest accounting for the §C5 metric
(every verdict call is part of the review tier's cost).

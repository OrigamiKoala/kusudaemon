"""§C5 — the five fixed eval tasks (PLAN.md §C5, line 651).

Each task is a goal plus the canned provider responses a fake model would
have to return for that tier's phases, plus the fixture input (a corpus
string for ``kind="text"`` tasks, a generated workspace tree for
``kind="workspace"`` tasks). The runner (``runner.py``) turns one of these
into a real ``RecursiveDriver`` run.

Call budgets for a first run, per task (derived from the phase machinery,
not asserted here — ``runner.py`` measures them):

- T0: 1  (ESTIMATE only; the direct node's review is free — no judgment
         items, ``v1/reviewer.py`` auto-passes)
- T1: 1  (ESTIMATE only; the one node is built by code, never a plan call)
- T2: 3  (ESTIMATE + PARTITION + 1 merged windowed document-review call —
         A5-4 fused coverage/duplication/contract into one call per
         window, with ``keep_depth_pass=False`` per ``driver.py:_phase_
         review``)
- T3: 2  (ESTIMATE + PARTITION; pilot auto-approves with a blank edit →
         zero contract-derivation calls; T3's review phase spends
         nothing; ``needs_explore=False`` and short plan briefs keep
         probe/research dispatch at zero)

Resume (a second driver against the same run dir) re-runs the
tier-scoped phases only: ``review@T2`` re-runs document review → 1 call
(consumed only when the §E17 input-digest cache misses); T0/T1/T3 resume
with zero provider calls (classify/plan/pilot all short-circuit on their
durable artifacts; execute re-runs the round loop over an already-passed
tree, which dispatches nothing).

Every plan brief is deliberately <=7 words with ``prose-dominant`` shape,
so ``v4/probe_planner.py``'s ``needs_probe`` filter (>=8 words, or a
structural shape marker, or an external-lookup marker) admits zero
candidates and no probe-planning call is ever spent.
